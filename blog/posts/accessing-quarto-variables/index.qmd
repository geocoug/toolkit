You can [access dynamic variables](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/variables.html) within documents, which can be useful for externalizing content that varies depending on context. As an example, you can reference file metadata using the syntax `{< meta title >}`, which would include the title of this article: **{{< meta title >}}**.

Isn't that cool?  {{< fa face-smile >}}
