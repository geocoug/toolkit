This page describes data management processes and data flows for projects (or project tasks) that include the collection and chemical analysis of environmental samples.  An alternative workflow for the compilation and synthesis of data from other sources is described on the companion wiki page Data Management Workflow for Historical Data.

Data management processes and data flows are shown in the following data flow diagram (DFD).  Each of the processes and data flows are described in following sections.  This DFD uses Yourdon/DeMarco symbology, as described by Wikipedia.  Note that a DFD is not a flowchart, and the arrows in the DFD do not represent sequence or control flow.  A flowchart analogue follows the DFD, but the DFD is a more detailed and useful representation for a data-based workflow.

The following diagrams can be viewed more clearly by zooming this page or by downloading the images or viewing them in a separate browser tab.

The flowchart to the right is a representation of the same processes that shows the ideal sequence, or flow of control, between them.  In a typical project there may be additional feedback loops and forward skips that are not shown here (forward skips include, for example, analyses that are conducted on data before they are validated).  The actual sequence of processes in a project may therefore be (or become) less organized than shown in this flowchart.  The DFD shows data-based, rather than control-based, relationships between processes, and is generally more stable than the flowchart.  Controlling the control flow is a project management challenge rather than a data management challenge, though it affects data management processes through impacts on schedule and budget.  The person responsible for each processs should be identified in the project plan.  This responsibility includes ensuring that data quality is improved or maintained within the task's scope and budget.  This responsibility may be held by one of the individuals who carry out each process, or by other project staff.

The processes shown in the diagram above, and described in the section below, and also those on the page Data Management Workflow for Historical Data, should be considered for separate project tasks, or subtasks under a data management task.  Budgeting, and tracking scope and budget by these processes, can help to more accurately estimate budgets and schedule, and to track progress throughout a project.

## Processes

### P1. Data Management Planning

This process should ordinarily be conducted as part of project planning.  It should be carried out jointly by the project manager and the project data manager.  This process may include:

- Identification of data needed for analyses and reporting, based on project goals (the DQO process).
- Identification of data needed for export, if data are to be transmitted to other organizations.
- Completion of a project initiation checklist.
- Development of a scope description for data management activities.
- Identification of the data model needed and requirements for field sample identification.
- Identification of analytical laboratories, analytical requirements, and electronic data deliverable (EDD) formats.
- Determination of the coordinate reference system and basemap data to be used.
- Budgeting for data management activities.
- Development of a Data Management Plan.
- Initiation of a project database and GIS project.

Other activities may be conducted and products produced if the project will require other types of data, such as historical data.

### P2. Field Program Planning

This process should be carried out jointly by the field program lead, field staff, and project data manager.  The process may include:

- Specification of procedures, tools, and forms to be used to collect information in the field.
- Specification of rules for naming and labelling locations, collections, interpretive samples, analytical samples, and containers, and documentation in a SAP or FSP.
- Initialization of GPS hardware, software, and data.
- Training of field staff in field documentation requirements and procedures.

### P3. Field Sampling

This process is carried out by field staff.  The essential activity with respect to data management is the collection of field documentation as specified in the SAP or FSP.

### P4. Field EDD Compilation

Sampling information collected in the field must ordinarily be compiled into a format that represents location and sampling information in a form consistent with the data model used for the project.  Field EDD forms can be used for this purpose, for data that will be loaded into the database.  This process should be carried out by field staff, with support from the project data manager.

### P5. Import Field Data Into the Database

Field sampling information is imported into the project database from the field EDD formats (or other formats as determined during planning). This process is carried out by the data manager, but may require consultation with field staff if data quality issues are found with the field records. The standard procedure is to carry out this process using a SQL script.  The wiki page Workflows for Loading Data to Postgres describes the data loading process in more detail.

### P6. Laboratory Oversight

This process should be carried out by the project chemist.  Laboratory specifications, laboratory deliverables, and any additional analysis requests should all be handled by the project chemist as part of this process.  Coordination with data validators is also carried out as part of this process.  Ordinarily this process includes communication between the project chemist and the data manager regarding timing, format, and quality of the laboratory deliverables and validation results.

### P7. Load Lab EDD

This process is carried out by the project data manager.  Laboratory EDDs are loaded into the project database, and quality assurance checks of the data are carried out as part of this process.  The standard procedure is to carry out this process using a SQL script.  If the laboratory EDD format is one that has been previously used, then an existing loading script may be used or customized; if not, a new script will have to be developed (and if so, a budget for this effort should have been established during the planning process).  The wiki page Workflows for Loading Data to Postgres describes the data loading process in more detail, particularly when a script must be developed for a new EDD format.  If problems are found with the EDD format or content, the data manager should communicate these to the project chemist for resolution with the laboratory.

### P8. Produce Validation Summary

This process is carried out by the project data manager. After each laboratory EDD is loaded to the database, those data are extracted and summarized into a spreadsheet for use by the data validators.  This procedure is carried out using a SQL script.

### P9. Validate Analytical Results

This process is carried out by validation chemists, either in-house or contracted.  This process results in the assignment of validation qualifiers to analytical results.  Those qualifiers should be recorded in the validation summary spreadsheet.

### P10. Load Validation Qualifiers

This process is carried out by the project data manager.  Data validation qualifiers are extracted from the data validation summary spreadsheet and added to the corresponding values in the database.  This procedure is carried out using a SQL script.

### P11. Data Usability Assessment

Prior to conducting statistical, geospatial, or other analyses, the usability of the selected data should be assessed.  This process should be carried out by the data analyst and project data manager, depending on the type of assessment to be performed and the best tool or technology for the job.  The data usability assessment may make use of metrics for the different dimensions of data quality.  This process ordinarily starts with the production of appropriate data summaries by the data manager.

### P12. Data Analysis and Visualization

This process should be carried out primarily by the data analyst, but the first step in analyses will frequently be the selection, extaction, and summarization of data from the database, and that step may be carried out by the project data manager.  The Data Accessibility page describes a variety of different ways in which data can be accessed and summarized by either data managers or other project staff.  A number of standard data summaries are available that meet many common data needs.  These standard summaries may be used as is, or customized.  More specialized data summaries may need to be created to support some analyses.  Often data summarization could be carried out using either SQL or analysis software (e.g., R, Python, Julia), and the most appropriate approach should be identified through discussions between data analysts and data managers.

Summaries of chemistry data should use the default rules for summarization of chemistry data or explicitly specify alternate data handling rules.  Additional information on data summarization (primarily for data managers) is presented on the pages Producing Custom Data Summaries and Guidance and Tips for Data Managers.  Custom scripts have also been developed to prepare data for some types of specialized analyses (e.g., unmixing, HCPCA, and t-SNE).  Otherwise, custom data summarization scripts may need to be developed for particular analyses (if so, a budget for this effort should have been developed during the planning process).

Data analyses should follow relevant recommendations on Data Analysis Standards and Guidance and Best Practices for Data Analysis, and avoid the Worst Practices for Data Analysis.  An initial stage of data exploration may be facilitated by using some of the available GUI Tools for Data Exploration.

Requests for data that are to be used for analysis and visualization may be recorded in a request tracker.  Templates and examples are in M:\DataManagement\Request_trackers.

Although data analysis and visualization is described here as a single process, frequently it is a multi-step process that could could be described by its own flowchart, data flow diagram, work breakdown structure, or other type of process map.  Describing and documenting the planned data analysis process during project planning, and accounting for variances, can help to ensure that this work is carried out in a way that clearly supports project goals and is performed in an orderly and efficient fashion.

### P13. Data Table Production

This process is carried out by the project data manager.  Data to be reported as a project deliverable are extracted from the project database and restructured and formatted as appropriate.  This process is ordinarily scripted.  The wiki page Producing Data Summaries describes the major steps in this process.  The section "Producing Data Tables for Reports or for Data Analyses" on the wiki page Guidance and Tips for Data Managers contains guidelines for the production of report data tables.

Requests for data that are to be used for data table production may be recorded in a request tracker.  Templates and examples are in M:\DataManagement\Request_trackers.

### P14. Data Reporting

This process is carried out cooperatively by multiple project staff.  Reports may include data tables, graphics, and maps prepared by DMA staff and others.  This process ordinarily requires that more effort be applied to consistency of data representation and adherence to publication standards than do the data analysis and visualization activities.

### P20. Correct Data Quality Issues

Initiation of data analyses, and the associated data usability assessment (P11) may reveal data quality issues that were not identified during initial data compilation and loading.  These issues are typically identified by a data analyst, and resolution of an issue may involve data managers, data analysts, field staff, and the project manager.  These issues may be recorded in a data issue log while a resolution is being developed (use of a data issue log is shown as part of the workflow for historical data).

### P21. Export Data

This process may not be required for all projects.  When data must be exported to a regulator or some other organization, the data ordinarily must be retrieved from the project database and prepared in a specified data exchange format or EDD.  The EDD format that is used for data exchange between organizations is typically different from the EDD format in which laboratory results are delivered.  The data exchange EDD format may be specified by the external organization or may be determined by a negotiation between Integral and that organization.  Some external organizations may require data that Integral would not typically record (e.g., during field work), and so export data requirements must be considered during project and data management planning.  This task is ordinarily carried out by data managers, but may require some support from other project staff.

Exporting data should be carried out following the process described on the wiki page Producing Data Summaries.  Requests for data that are to be exported for others may be recorded in a request tracker.
