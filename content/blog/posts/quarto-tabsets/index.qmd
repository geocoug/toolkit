Tabsets can be useful when you want to show multiple flavors of the same thing. For example, what's the command to copy files on [PowerShell](/content/development/code/powershell.qmd), [CMD](/content/development/code/cmd.qmd), and [Bash](/content/development/code/bash.qmd)?

:::{.panel-tabset}

## Bash

Copy a file or directory.

```sh
cp -rf file.txt ./output/
```

## PowerShell

Copy a file or directory.

```powershell
CopyItem -Recurse -Force file.txt .\output\
```

## CMD

Copy a file or directory.

```powershell
xcopy file.txt .\output\ /E/H
```
