The steps below can be used to merge two branches on your local machine. The braches used in this example are:

* `main`: The authoritative or "production" code lives in this branch.
* `dev`: This branch is split from the `main` branch and a new feature or update is coded with the intent to merge changes back into the `main` branch.

1. Pull `main` and `dev` branches so local repo is up to date with the remote.
    1. `git checkout main`
    1. `git pull origin main`
    1. `git checkout dev`
    1. `git pull origin dev`

2. Checkout the main branch so we can merge the `dev` branch into `main`
    1. `git checkout main`
    1. `git merge dev`

3. Check the branch status: `git status`

4. Evaluate the two files with a conflict (ie. `.gitignore` and `requirements.txt`) and reconcile issues, then `git add` when ready.

5. Commit the changes: `git commit -m "merge @tnelson-integral dev branch with main"`

6. Push changes to the remote on GitHub: `git push origin main`

7. Check out the `dev` branch locally and pull the `main` branch changes into it so `dev` can be up-to-date with `main`
    1. `git checkout dev`
    1. `git pull origin main`
    1. `git push origin dev`
