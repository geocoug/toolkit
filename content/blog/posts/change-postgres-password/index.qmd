Open command prompt or PowerShell (Start > type “CMD”> press enter) and enter the command below after you’ve replaced **USERNAME** and **YOUR NEW PASSWORD**. Make sure you don’t delete any of the quotes in this command:

`psql -U USERNAME -h env4 -d db_inventory -c "alter role USERNAME with password 'YOUR NEW PASSWORD'"`

The command will ask you for your current password once, then set your new password.
