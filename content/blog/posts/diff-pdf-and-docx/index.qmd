If you have a `PDF` and `DOCX` of the _same_ document and want to check for difference in text, use `diff` to compare them. Since we’re using `--word-diff`, it doesn’t matter that the two files use _wildly_ different line wrapping.

```sh
gs -q -sDEVICE=txtwrite -o- file1.pdf > file1.txt
pandoc -t plain file2.docx > file2.txt
git diff --no-index --word-diff file1.txt file2.txt
```

Or create a shortcut...

```sh
alias pdfcat='gs -q -sDEVICE=txtwrite -o-'
alias doccat='pandoc -t plain'
pdfcat file1.pdf > file1.txt
doccat file2.docx > file2.txt
git diff --no-index --word-diff file1.txt file2.txt
```
