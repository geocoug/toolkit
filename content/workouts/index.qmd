## Intermediate Routines

### Version 1

```{python}
import polars as pl

workouts = "../../static/resources/workouts.xlsx"
back_biceps = pl.read_excel(workouts, sheet_id=1)
chest_triceps = pl.read_excel(workouts, sheet_id=2)
legs = pl.read_excel(workouts, sheet_id=3)
shoulders_traps = pl.read_excel(workouts, sheet_id=4)
```

The following regimen can be used for any 5 day/week workout schedule. I typically workout Monday-Friday, where each lift is executed once Monday-Thursday, and any targeted muscle group is performed again on Friday.

#### Back & Biceps

```{python}
back_biceps.to_pandas().fillna("").to_html(index=False, render_links=True)
```

#### Chest & Triceps

```{python}
chest_triceps.to_pandas().fillna("").to_html(index=False, render_links=True)
```

#### Legs

```

#### Shoulders & Traps
