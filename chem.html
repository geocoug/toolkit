<div id="summarization" class="section level2">
<h2>Summarization</h2>
<p>Chemistry data frequently is summarized for use in analyses or for
presentation using tables or maps. Summarization is ordinarily performed
when there are multiple concentration values measured for a sample, or
for a specific location, date, and depth. Multiple concentration values
result from field or laboratory replications, from field splits created
for quality control evaluations, and sometimes from sample reanalyses.
Although field splits and laboratory replicates are created to support
data quality assessments, all of the valid results that are produced are
informative, are ordinarily stored in the project database, and are used
to produce the most accurate possible estimate of the true concentration
in a sample. When there are replicate results for a sample, the data
will be averaged in a stepwise, or hierarchical, fashion. Because each
level of the hierarchy represents a different source of variation, all
the results at a single level are averaged together before results are
averaged across levels. The different levels of replication, and the
source of variation that each represents, are as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Average across lab replicates<br></li>
<li>Average across multiple analyses (if they exist) for the same lab
sample. This will average across multiple methods and reanalyses
(different SDGs)<br></li>
<li>Average across multiple lab samples (if they exist) for the same
sample number (split) and lab. Multiple lab samples may exist for the
same sample number if the laboratory has created new laboratory sample
IDs for reanalyses.<br></li>
<li>Average across multiple splits (if they exist) for the same lab and
interpretive sample. Multiple sample numbers (splits) may exist for the
same lab, or the same sample number may exist for different labs. Splits
sent to different labs potentially have an additional source of
variability in addition to variability between splits sent to the same
lab.<br></li>
<li>Average across laboratories for the same main sample. This
summarizes data by main sample (sample_id), which is typically the
lowest level of data summarization to be used for data
interpretation.</li>
</ol>
<p>By default, data are summarized by successive averaging across these
levels of replication, in the order given above. During the averaging
process, data validation qualifiers and significant digits must be
propagated. The rules for propagating the data validation qualifiers U
(undetected), J (estimated), and R (rejected) are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If both detected and undetected data are to be averaged, then
undetected data lower than the highest detected value will be taken at
one-half the detection limit and averaged with the detected data, and
the result will be identified as detected. Non-detects that are higher
than the highest detected value will be omitted from the average.</li>
<li>If all data to be averaged are undetected, the result will be taken
to be the lowest detection limit, and will be identified as
undetected.</li>
<li>If J-qualified data are averaged with non-J-qualified data, the
result will be J-qualified.</li>
<li>If R-qualified data are averaged with non-R-qualified data, the
result will be R-qualified.</li>
</ul>
<p>Significant digits are propagated so that the place (in the sense of
one’s place, ten’s place, etc.) of the least significant digit of the
average is equal to the highest place of the least significant digit of
any of the values that are averaged.</p>
<p>These rules are built into custom aggregate functions in IDB that use
the measurement_result data type.</p>
<p>These default data handling rules will be applied if no
project-specific alternate rules are specified. The project manager,
project technical staff, and data manager should evaluate, at the start
of a project, whether an alternative approach is needed. Alternate data
summarization rules should be summarized in the project plan or in the
data management plan, if it exists. (Data managers: if not documented
elsewhere, record this information in the Data Manager’s Manual.)</p>
<p>Note that the handling of nondetects during hierarchical averaging
and the presentation of nondetects in data summaries may be different.
Regardless of whether nondetects are taken at half the detection limit
or the full detection limit when averaging, the summarized result may be
presented with either the full detection limit or half the detection
limit. Reporting nondetects at the full detection limit should
ordinarily be done when preparing data tables for reports or other
deliverables. Data analyses to be conducted by Integral may be carried
out using either half or full detection limits. The method of reporting
nondetects should be specified when requesting data summaries.</p>

<div id="character-encoding" class="section level2">
<h2>Character Encoding</h2>
<p>We deal with character encoding issues when importing data to
databases all the time. All databases are encoded in UTF-8, and the most
common non-ASCII, non-UTF-8 format is Microsoft’s custom encoding, which
is CP-1252 (also known as win-1252 and a few other things). The
character encoding of a file can’t necessarily be definitively
determined by examination, but the Linux command-line tool file
generally does a good job. (It’s available on the “rstudio” server.)
Also, the Geany editor does a good job of diagnosing file formats. If
you want to change the encoding of a file rather than importing it in a
known format, the Linux command-line tool iconv will do that for you.
There’s a Python library on PyPI named chardet that will also diagnose
file encodings.</p>
<p>For data managers, the workflow is to first guess that encoding
errors on data import are due to the file being cp-1252. That covers
about 90% of cases. Our import tool also automatically diagnoses
instances where a file starts with a byte order mark (BOM), which covers
most of the rest of the cases. For the remainders, Geany is usually the
quickest way to check the file encoding.</p>
<p>Everything that comes out of our databases is always in UTF-8, so I,
at least, don’t ordinarily have encoding issues when importing data to
R. For those who use data from other sources, it is a good idea to
document a recommended workflow and set of tools.</p>

<h3>PCBs</h3>
<p><a
href="https://www.epa.gov/pcbs/learn-about-polychlorinated-biphenyls-pcbs">Learn
about PCBs</a></p>
<div id="general" class="section level4">
<h4>General</h4>
<p>PCBs are a group of man-made organic chemicals consisting of carbon,
hydrogen and chlorine atoms. The number of chlorine atoms and their
location in a PCB molecule determine many of its physical and chemical
properties. PCBs have no known taste or smell, and range in consistency
from an oil to a waxy solid.</p>
<p>PCBs belong to a broad family of man-made organic chemicals known as
chlorinated hydrocarbons. PCBs were domestically manufactured from 1929
until manufacturing was banned in 1979. They have a range of toxicity
and vary in consistency from thin, light-colored liquids to yellow or
black waxy solids. Due to their non-flammability, chemical stability,
high boiling point and electrical insulating properties, PCBs were used
in hundreds of industrial and commercial applications including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electrical, heat transfer and hydraulic equipment</li>
<li>Plasticizers in paints, plastics and rubber products</li>
<li>Pigments, dyes and carbonless copy paper</li>
<li>Other industrial applications</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Commercial Uses for PCBs</strong></p>
<p>Although no longer commercially produced in the United States, PCBs
may be present in products and materials produced before the 1979 PCB
ban. Products that may contain PCBs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transformers and capacitors</li>
<li>Electrical equipment including voltage regulators, switches,
re-closers, bushings, and electromagnets</li>
<li>Oil used in motors and hydraulic systems</li>
<li>Old electrical devices or appliances containing PCB capacitors</li>
<li>Fluorescent light ballasts</li>
<li>Cable insulation</li>
<li>Thermal insulation material including fiberglass, felt, foam, and
cork</li>
<li>Adhesives and tapes</li>
<li>Oil-based paint</li>
<li>Caulking</li>
<li>Plastics</li>
<li>Carbonless copy paper</li>
<li>Floor finish</li>
</ul>
<p>The PCBs used in these products were chemical mixtures made up of a
variety of individual chlorinated biphenyl components known as
congeners. Most commercial PCB mixtures are known in the United States
by their industrial trade names, the most common being Arochlor.</p>
<p><strong>Release and Exposure of PCBs</strong></p>
<p>Today, PCBs can still be released into the environment from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Poorly maintained hazardous waste sites that contain PCBs</li>
<li>Illegal or improper dumping of PCB wastes</li>
<li>Leaks or releases from electrical transformers containing PCBs</li>
<li>Disposal of PCB-containing consumer products into municipal or other
landfills not designed to handle hazardous waste</li>
<li>Burning some wastes in municipal and industrial incinerators</li>
</ul>
<p>PCBs do not readily break down once in the environment. They can
remain for long periods cycling between air, water and soil. PCBs can be
carried long distances and have been found in snow and sea water in
areas far from where they were released into the environment. As a
consequence, they are found all over the world. In general, the lighter
the form of PCB, the further it can be transported from the source of
contamination.</p>
<p>PCBs can accumulate in the leaves and above-ground parts of plants
and food crops. They are also taken up into the bodies of small
organisms and fish. As a result, people who ingest fish may be exposed
to PCBs that have bioaccumulated in the fish they are ingesting.</p>
<p>The National Center for Health Statistics, a division of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, conducts the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). NHANES is a series of U.S.
national surveys on the health and nutrition status of the
noninstitutionalized civilian population, which includes data collection
on selected chemicals. Interviews and physical examinations are
conducted with approximately 10,000 people in each two-year survey
cycle. PCBs are one of the chemicals where data are available from the
NHANES surveys.</p>

<h4>PCB Congeners</h4>
<p>A PCB congener is any single, unique well-defined chemical compound
in the PCB category. The name of a congener specifies the total number
of chlorine substituents, and the position of each chlorine. For
example: 4,4’-Dichlorobiphenyl is a congener comprising the biphenyl
structure with two chlorine substituents - one on each of the #4 carbons
of the two rings. In 1980, a numbering system was developed which
assigned a sequential number to each of the 209 PCB congeners.</p>
</div>
<div id="pcb-homologs" class="section level4">
<h4>PCB Homologs</h4>
<p>Homologs are subcategories of PCB congeners that have equal numbers
of chlorine substituents. For example, the tetrachlorobiphenyls are all
PCB congeners with exactly 4 chlorine substituents that can be in any
arrangement.</p>

<div id="pcb-aroclor" class="section level4">
<h4>PCB Aroclor</h4>
<p>Aroclor is a PCB mixture produced from approximately 1930 to 1979. It
is one of the most commonly known trade names for PCB mixtures. There
are many types of Aroclors and each has a distinguishing suffix number
that indicates the degree of chlorination. The numbering standard for
the different Aroclors is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first two digits usually refer to the number of carbon atoms in
the phenyl rings (for PCBs this is 12)</li>
<li>The second two numbers indicate the percentage of chlorine by mass
in the mixture. For example, the name Aroclor 1254 means that the
mixture contains approximately 54% chlorine by weight.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Labs may apply whatever flags they want to a result. Some data
qualifiers are defined by EPA’s Functional Guidelines documents, which
describe how data validation is to be conducted, and the use and
interpretation of U, J, and R qualifiers is pretty universal (but older
standards for Puget Sound data used E instead of J). Because the U, J,
and R qualifiers are pretty universal and have implications for data
usability, they are the only ones that are represented as Boolean fields
in the meas_value column. All lab flags are put into the lab_flags
column, and there is no lookup table for them, and there is no defined
use for them. Similarly, the validator qualifiers (U, J, R, and possibly
others) are put in the validator_flags column. If any of those three
common qualifiers is in the validator_flags column, then the
corresponding flags in meas_value should be set. The lab_conc_qual
column is something of a relic, left over from the days when data were
commonly provided in EPA’s Contract Laboratory Program (CLP) data
format, which had a corresponding column. The lab_conc_qual column was
meant to either contain “U” or be null. We don’t ordinarily use that
column any more. Of the qualifiers you listed above, other than U, J,
and R, N is commonly used to flag a tentatively identified compound,
which means that the analyte code itself is uncertain. The
d_labresult.tic column is meant to hold that information. The tic column
is not part of the measurement_result data type because it is not used
in any way during data aggregation (averaging or summing). I see that
Jerry added other flags and qualifiers to the e_concqual table, but
needn’t—really shouldn’t—be there. The e_concqual dictionary should have
only “U” defined. It may seem odd to define a lookup table for only one
value when a check constraint on the concentration qualifier columns
could be used instead, but it’s easier to check relational constraints
than to check check constraints programmatically.</p>

<h2>Duplicates</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Duplicate” is a somewhat ambiguous term, but in practice it most
commonly refers to field duplicates, which we ordinarily refer to as
splits to avoid that ambiguity. Some QC data, particularly spikes, are
frequently duplicated, so when we have lab QC data we may have values
for spikes and spike duplicates. When we receive lab results in one big
flat table that includes both analytical results for natural samples and
results of lab QC samples, the word or code “DUP” in a column header or
table cell could mean a couple of different things. Without seeing the
original data source, I’m not sure where the “DUP” code in the
“labqc_samp” column of your “d_labsample” table came from. I’m going to
assume that it refers to a field duplicate, and not a spike
duplicate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ideally, samples are submitted to the laboratory “blind” so that the
laboratory does not know which field samples are duplicates of one
another. This is to prevent them from seeing that there’s a lot of
variation between some pair of duplicates and deciding to re-run one or
both of them. If the lab is producing highly variable data, we don’t
want them to be able to hide it. Unfortunately, many field sampling
programs use a suffix of “-D” or “-DUP” or something like that on the
sample ID, so the lab knows which samples are field duplicates. If they
know, they may pass that information back in their EDD.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Although field duplicates are used as a QC check on laboratory
performance, they are not lab QC samples themselves. They are just
normal field samples (which have been split), and don’t need to have a
laboratory QC sample ID assigned to them. Thus, field duplicates should
not be listed in the “d_labqcsamp” table, so that table looks fine as it
appears below. The same is true for the “d_labresult” table.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a couple of things to be changed about the “d_labsample”
table as shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li>The values in the “labqc_samp” column should be identifiers that
appear in the “d_labqcsamp” table, not codes. The codes for the lab QC
type should be in the d_labqcsamp.qc_type column, and neither “Natural”
nor “DUP” should be used there.</li>
<li>The “d_labsample” table should have values in the “study_id” and
“sample_no” columns, or a value in the “labqc_samp” column, but not
both. There are other invalid combinations of columns also. The
“d_labsample” table may have any one of the following tables as a
parent: d_sampsplit, d_fldqcsplit, d_labqcsamp, d_bioaccum_samp,
d_samptreatsplit, or d_bioasrepsamp. The “ck_one_sample” check
constraint on the table enforces this rule. Check constraints like this
are not run by the upsert scripts, so a set of staged data may pass all
the checks performed by the upsert script and yet the INSERT into
d_labsample will fail.</li>
</ul>

<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
<li>Data for soil and sediment are almost always reported on a
dry-weight basis. If there’s anything to indicate a different basis,
that deserves a closer look. Almost the only legitimate reason for a
different basis for soil or sediment samples is when a leaching
procedure has been applied (e.g., the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching
Procedure, or TCLP); in those cases the data may be reported as the
concentration in the leachate, so the basis may be “Wet” or “Whole” or
“Unfiltered” – anything indicating an unfractionated liquid sample.</li>
<li>Data for tissues should ordinarily be reported in wet weight.
Organisms’ homeostasis means that they maintain a nearly constant
moisture content in their tissues, whereas the same is not true of
materials like soil or sediment. If tissue data are reported in dry
weight, check it carefully: labs can be sloppy about that.</li>
<li>Water data are where things can be complex, because often water
samples are filtered or centrifuged to remove particulates, which
results in the water samples have a ‘dissolved’ basis. If the
particulates are analyzed, and the results are then expressed in terms
of the volume of the original sample, then the data will have a
‘particulate’ basis. Unfiltered, or whole, water, should have a basis of
‘Unfilt’, ‘Whole’, or sometimes ‘Wet’. Either of the first two of these
are preferred, “Wet” is better used as a counterpart to “Dry” for soil,
sediment, or tissue samples.</li>
<li>There are variations in the way things have been done in different
databases. You may find that the measurement basis code for whole water
samples differs from one to another, as in the third bullet above.</li>
<li>IDB v.8 now has the “fraction” code, which is intended to be used to
distinguish dissolved, particulate, and whole fractions of a water
sample. In IDB v.8, the measurement basis for water samples will almost
always be ‘Whole’. Sometimes sediment or soil samples are fractionated
too, e.g., by sieving, and the fraction code should be used in those
cases too, so the measurement basis will always be ‘dry’ in those
cases.</li>
<li>There is an implicit association between measurement bases and
units. For example, if the measurement basis is “Dry”, the units should
not be “mg/L” because “…/L” implies a liquid, not a solid.</li>
<li>The measurement basis refers to the form of the sample material,
which is represented in the denominator of concentration units. So codes
of “Sediment” “Arsenic”, “mg/kg”, “Dry” should be read as “mg of arsenic
per kg of dry sediment.”</li>

<h3>Wet Weight</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Wet weight (or as-is) basis means no calculation has been made to
compensate for the moisture content of a sample. Wet weight refers to
the weight of animal tissue or other substance including its contained
water. (See also “Dry weight”)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="dry-weight" class="section level3">
<h3>Dry Weight</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Dry weight basis means the lab has measured moisture content of a
sample and calculated concentrations based on the percent solids
present. Dry weight refers to the weight of animal tissue after it has
been dried in an oven at 65°C until a constant weight is achieved. Dry
weight represents total organic and inorganic matter in the tissue. (See
also “Wet weight”).</p>

<h2>Analytical Blanks</h2>
<div id="trip-blank" class="section level3">
<h3>Trip Blank</h3>
<p>The trip blank is designed to identify levels of contamination from
the exposure of the reagent or sorbent bed to the same atmospheres
exposed to the analyte reagent or sorbent bed. The trip blank is
prepared in the laboratory with the other reagents or adsorbents prior
to shipping to the field. However, the trip blank is never exposed to
the field atmospheres. It is simply sent along with the field samples to
and from the site. The trip blank identified areas of exposure such as
shipping temperatures and pressures, laboratory preparation of field
samples and laboratory preparation of field samples for analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="field-blank" class="section level3">
<h3>Field Blank</h3>
<p>The field blank is similar to the trip blank in that it is also
prepared during the preparation of the field reagents or adsorbents.
However, the field blank is exposed to the same atmospheres in the field
as the field samples. This means that the field blank is opened during
the charging of impingers or sorbents in the sample train. The field
blank is also exposed during the exchanging of cartridges in SW-846,
Method 0030 or when field reagents are being exchanged during a test
run. In summary, field blanks consist of additional sample collection
media (e.g., sorbent tubes, reagents, filters) which are transported to
the monitoring site, exposed briefly at the site when the samples are
exposed (but no stack gas is actually pulled through these blanks), and
transported back to the laboratory for analysis, similar to a field
sample. At least one field blank should be collected and analyzed for
each test series.</p>
</div>
<div id="laboratory-blank" class="section level3">
<h3>Laboratory Blank</h3>
<p>The laboratory blank is a sample of the reagents or sorbents used
during the sample train reagent preparation or recovery. The laboratory
blank is a sample of the extraction solvent, the rinses used during
sample recovery, or a sample from the batch of sorbent used to preparing
sampling cartridges. Laboratory blanks include both method blanks and
instrument blanks. Method blanks are carried through all steps of the
measurement process (from extraction through analysis). A method blank
is typically analyzed with each sample batch. Instrument blanks are used
to demonstrate that an instrument system is free of contamination.
Instrument blanks are typically analyzed prior to sample analysis and
following the analysis of highly contaminated samples.</p>
</div>
<div id="reagent-blank" class="section level3">
<h3>Reagent Blank</h3>
<p>The reagent blank is a sample of the solvents used during recovery of
the sample train after the test is completed. You recall, reagent blanks
for both multi-metal and chromium +6 require that the reagent blank be
the same volume as the renses used to recover the samples, from probe to
impinger. This is because the blank value is substracted from the sample
to obtain a final concentration.</p>
